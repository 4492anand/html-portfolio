<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Burning Money to Keep Warm:  Escobar was once on the run in the mountains with his family. It got chilly, 
  and guess what he used to heat them up? Millions of dollars in cash!  
  He literally burned piles of money to stay warm because he had so much and nowhere to store it safely. 
  Some estimates say he lost millions more to rats who liked to burrow into his stashes.</p>

<p>The Private Zoo: Escobar had a strange fascination with exotic animals. He built his own private zoo on his hacienda, 
  complete with hippos, elephants, and even giraffes.  Imagine relaxing by the pool next to a lion!  Apparently, 
  some of these animals are still roaming around the Colombian countryside today.</p>

<p>The Hippo Hacienda:  Escobar wasn't just rich, he was eccentric. 
  He built a private zoo at his hacienda, complete with exotic animals like hippos, giraffes, and even lions. 
  Imagine lounging by the pool with a hippopotamus for company! 
  Some of these animals are said to be descendants of Escobar's collection and are still roaming around Colombia today.</p>
